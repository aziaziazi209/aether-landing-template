# "Aether" Landing Page Template

Thank you for purchasing the Aether template! This premium landing page is designed to be beautiful, modern, and easy to customize.

This document will guide you through editing the template to fit your needs.

### What's Included

The .zip file contains the following structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file. All text content is located here.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing all the styles for the template.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the on-scroll animations.
- `images/`: A folder containing the placeholder image for the hero section.

### How to Customize

Getting your site live is simple. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Editing Text Content

Open the `index.html` file in any code editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad). You can find all the text sections and replace the placeholder content with your own. The code is commented to help you identify each section easily.

Example:
```html
<!-- HERO SECTION -->
<section class="hero">
    <div class="container">
        <!-- Change this H1 to your main headline -->
        <h1 class="animate-on-scroll">The Next Generation of <br><span class="gradient-text">Productivity Software</span></h1>
        <!-- Change this paragraph to your subtitle -->
        <p class="subtitle animate-on-scroll">Aether is a beautifully designed, blazingly fast tool...</p>
    </div>
</section>
